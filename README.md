## After much feet-dragging, I have made a personal website.

Please, hold your applause. :clap:

I'm Katie, I'm a Product Designer in San Francisco who sometimes tries to code.

You can check out my site at [katieriley.co](http://katieriley.co/) or my Dribbble at [katieriley.dribbble.com](http://katieriley.dribbble.com/).
